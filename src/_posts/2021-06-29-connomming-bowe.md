I've caught myself [connomming][] again. The names might not look that similar
but try saying them out loud:

- [**Bowe Bergdahl**][berg] is a soldier in the United States Army who was held
  captive by the Taliban from 2009 to 2014 but is suspected of being a deserter;
  and
- [**Bo Burnham**][burn] is an American comedic musician in the vein of Tim Minchin.

The mixup came to my attention after realising that the guy with the [new
Netflix special][inside] surely couldn't be the guy who was held in Afghanistan
for years and years.
