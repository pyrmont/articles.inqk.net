Has the term [connomming][] caught on yet? No? Well, I'm still doing it. The latest:

- [**Walter Russell Mead**][mead] is an American academic who writes on American political issues (typically concerning foreign policy);
  and
- [**Walter Reed**][reed] was a U.S. army physician in the 19th Century, most famous today as the namesake of Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

This one came to my attention after coming across Mead's [2012 article][article] about the history of racial compromise in U.S. politics.
