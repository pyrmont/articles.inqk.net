title: Why Disclaim Copyright?

The short answer is that I want to do what I can to replenish the cultural commons.

Modern copyright periods are excessive. In many countries, the copyright subsisting in a piece of work will last 50 to 100 years _after_ the death of the author. Moreover, there will be severe restrictions on what other people can do with that work during the term of copyright.

My work is not that precious. I don't harbour any delusions that the articles in this blog are of a great benefit to humanity but to the extent that they are useful to others, I'd like people to be able to use them without restriction.
